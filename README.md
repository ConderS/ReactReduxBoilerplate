# ReactReduxBoilerplate
My custom react redux boilerplate

- Check that the initilal step for initializing the app is the same in the [official React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)
- Inside the root folder, use `yarn create react-app <app_name_in_lowercase>` to initialize the app folder
- Use `mv <app_folder_name>/* .` to move folder contents up one level
- Delete with  `rm -rf <app_folder_name>`
- Replace `src` with the folder provided here
- Run `make` to install additional dependencies through the Makefile
